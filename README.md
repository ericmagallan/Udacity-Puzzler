# Udacity-Puzzler

---

**Description**
This was a virtual reality puzzler maze built in Unity gaming engine and coded in C#.The objective is to make your way through the maze using only teleportation points within a virtual reality space.

It was built as a part of an assignment through the Udacity VR Developer Nanodegree program. Some assets were provided as a startingn point, but it was up to me to create the maze structure, teleportation points and UX.

**Launching**
Currently trying to deploy to web instead of launching directly from withinn the native Unity app. I have to strip down some components in order for the app to run smoothly on a web browser. Coming soon!
